# Environment & Tools Used

This is a standard section in QA project documentation.  
It shows what tools, versions, and environments were used during testing — even for a mock API.

## Environment & Tools Used

This project was tested in a controlled mock environment designed to simulate typical API behavior. The following tools and configurations were used throughout the testing process.

---

## Testing Environment

- Mock API created using Postman Mock Server  
- Local test environment (no production systems involved)  
- Sample JSON responses defined manually for controlled behavior  
- No authentication or authorization layers implemented in this version  

---

## Tools Used

### **Postman**  
Used for sending requests, observing responses, and validating API behavior.

### **Postman Mock Server**  
Used to simulate API endpoints and control returned data.

### **Markdown / GitHub**  
Used for organizing and documenting test plans, scenarios, and test cases.

### **JSON Viewer / Formatter**  
Used to format and validate API responses for readability.

### **Basic spreadsheet or notes app**  
Used for drafting tests and comparing expected vs actual outcomes.

## System Details

- Testing performed on Windows or macOS environment (any standard OS applies)  
- Stable internet connection required only for Postman sync or GitHub updates  
- No external dependencies beyond Postman and GitHub  

---

## Assumptions

- API behavior is controlled through mock data and may not reflect a real backend  
- No database, caching, or server-side processing exists beyond mock responses  
- Business rules are defined manually and not enforced by a real system
